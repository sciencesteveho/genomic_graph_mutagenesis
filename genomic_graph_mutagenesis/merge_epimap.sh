# This script is used to convert epimap bigwigs to narrow or broad peak bedfiles
# with liftover to hg38. Broad peaks are called for histone marks and narrow
# peaks for TFs. Histones and TFs are then merged across the three samples to
# act as "representative" potential tracks for the given tissue.
# SECONDS=0

# convert bigwig to bed
# wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/bigWigToBedGraph
# If tracks are imputed AND track is one of the marks seen in the cutoffs array,
# then the cutoff value is changed to match the cutoff values provided by C.
# Boix
# Arguments:
#   $1 -Â pseudo bool, true if histone, false if TF
#   $2 - directory to bigWigToBedGraph
#   $3 - bigwig tissue directory
#   $4 - filename without extension
