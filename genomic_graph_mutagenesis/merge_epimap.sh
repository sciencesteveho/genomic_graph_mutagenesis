# This script is used to convert epimap bigwigs to narrow or broad peak bedfiles
# with liftover to hg38. Broad peaks are called for histone marks and narrow
# peaks for TFs. Histones and TFs are then merged across the three samples to
# act as "representative" potential tracks for the given tissue.
